# CatBlog

Cat blog returns!

Catblog is a Father / Daughter (she's 10!!) project to CATalog our favorite beasts we've found online.  Check it out => https://evescatblog.netlify.app/


Journals and Jokes
- Eve knows where to type, some of the web elements and how to copy / paste to create additional journal and joke entries.   

Cat Facts and Surfer
- We threw buttons on the app to grab a random cat fact or joke from cat APIs via AXIOS!

Cat Tiles
- She and I take turns populating the JSON array of our favorites so they can always be found! 

CI/CD
- Github (Main) => Netlify !


TODO
- ~~get some `hooks` and `state` in here, continue learning~~ DONE! Check out the Cat Facts API in the Cat of the Day component!
- ~~clean up some `CSS` and continue learning the design side~~ Lookin fine so far! Waiting on design changes from daughter side :)
- Ongoing battle against CSS and mobile viewport sizing... arrrggg!




To run
- clone project
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

To add Cats
- modify the `/src/data/cats.js` array and new cat cards will render via the `map()` function in `cardHolder.js` component
