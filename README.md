Another project for learning REACT development.  This is a collaboration with my daughter and I.  I've been building the components, and she has been filling in the data array of her favorite cats found in our internet web searches togehter. 

TODO
- ~~get some `hooks` and `state` in here, continue learning~~ DONE! Check out the Cat Facts API in the Cat of the Day component!
- ~~clean up some `CSS` and continue learning the design side~~ Lookin fine so far! Waiting on design changes from daughter side :)

To run
- clone project
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

To add Cats
- modify the `/src/data/cats.js` array and new cat cards will render via the `map()` function in `cardHolder.js` component
